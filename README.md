# Running/Building
You can either run with `cargo run -- <args>`, you can also run with no arguments to get a use message, or build the project with `cargo build` to build unoptimised with debug backtrace or `cargo build --release` to build optimised without the debug backtrace. After building the binaries would be available in either `target/debug` or `target/release` depending on if you built release or debug binaries.
